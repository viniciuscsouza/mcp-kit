<Info>**Protocol Revision**: 2024-11-05</Info>

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a rigorous lifecycle for client-server
connections that ensures proper capability negotiation and state management.

1. **Initialization**: Capability negotiation and protocol version agreement
2. **Operation**: Normal protocol communication
3. **Shutdown**: Graceful termination of the connection

## Lifecycle Phases

### Initialization

The initialization phase **MUST** be the first interaction between client and server.
During this phase, the client and server:

- Establish protocol version compatibility
- Exchange and negotiate capabilities
- Share implementation details

The client **MUST** initiate this phase by sending an `initialize` request containing:

- Protocol version supported
- Client capabilities
- Client implementation information

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "sampling": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleClient",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The server **MUST** respond with its own capabilities and information:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "logging": {},
      "prompts": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "resources": {
        "subscribe": true,
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "tools": {
        "listChanged": true
      }
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleServer",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

After successful initialization, the client **MUST** send an `initialized` notification
to indicate it is ready to begin normal operations:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/initialized"
}
```

- The client **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than
  [pings](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/utilities/ping) before the server
  has responded to the `initialize` request.
- The server **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than
  [pings](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/utilities/ping) and
  [logging](/specification/2024-11-05/server/utilities/logging) before
  receiving the `initialized` notification.

#### Version Negotiation

In the `initialize` request, the client **MUST** send a protocol version it supports.
This **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the client.

If the server supports the requested protocol version, it **MUST** respond with the same
version. Otherwise, the server **MUST** respond with another protocol version it
supports. This **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the server.

If the client does not support the version in the server's response, it **SHOULD**
disconnect.

#### Capability Negotiation

Client and server capabilities establish which optional protocol features will be
available during the session.

Key capabilities include:

| Category | Capability     | Description                                                                         |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client   | `roots`        | Ability to provide filesystem [roots](/specification/2024-11-05/client/roots)       |
| Client   | `sampling`     | Support for LLM [sampling](/specification/2024-11-05/client/sampling) requests      |
| Client   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features                            |
| Server   | `prompts`      | Offers [prompt templates](/specification/2024-11-05/server/prompts)                 |
| Server   | `resources`    | Provides readable [resources](/specification/2024-11-05/server/resources)           |
| Server   | `tools`        | Exposes callable [tools](/specification/2024-11-05/server/tools)                    |
| Server   | `logging`      | Emits structured [log messages](/specification/2024-11-05/server/utilities/logging) |
| Server   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features                            |

Capability objects can describe sub-capabilities like:

- `listChanged`: Support for list change notifications (for prompts, resources, and
  tools)
- `subscribe`: Support for subscribing to individual items' changes (resources only)

### Operation

During the operation phase, the client and server exchange messages according to the
negotiated capabilities.

Both parties **SHOULD**:

- Respect the negotiated protocol version
- Only use capabilities that were successfully negotiated

### Shutdown

During the shutdown phase, one side (usually the client) cleanly terminates the protocol
connection. No specific shutdown messages are definedâ€”instead, the underlying transport
mechanism should be used to signal connection termination:

#### stdio

For the stdio [transport](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports), the
client **SHOULD** initiate shutdown by:

1. First, closing the input stream to the child process (the server)
2. Waiting for the server to exit, or sending `SIGTERM` if the server does not exit
   within a reasonable time
3. Sending `SIGKILL` if the server does not exit within a reasonable time after `SIGTERM`

The server **MAY** initiate shutdown by closing its output stream to the client and
exiting.

#### HTTP

For HTTP [transports](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports), shutdown
is indicated by closing the associated HTTP connection(s).

## Error Handling

Implementations **SHOULD** be prepared to handle these error cases:

- Protocol version mismatch
- Failure to negotiate required capabilities
- Initialize request timeout
- Shutdown timeout

Implementations **SHOULD** implement appropriate timeouts for all requests, to prevent
hung connections and resource exhaustion.

Example initialization error:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Unsupported protocol version",
    "data": {
      "supported": ["2024-11-05"],
      "requested": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```
