# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

_Just heard of MCP and not sure where to start? See [the documentation website instead](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)._

This repo contains the:

- MCP specification
- MCP protocol schema
- Official MCP documentation

The schema is [defined in TypeScript](schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts) first, but
[made available as JSON Schema](schema/2025-06-18/schema.json) as well, for wider
compatibility.

The official MCP documentation is built using Mintlify and available at
[modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## Authors

The Model Context Protocol was created by David Soria Parra ([@dsp](https://github.com/dsp)) and Justin Spahr-Summers ([@jspahrsummers](https://github.com/jspahrsummers)).
